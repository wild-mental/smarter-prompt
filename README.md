# SMART+ER PROMPT
A smarter SMART+ER prompt template provided by Everyone's AI

## 1. Background of the SMARTER Prompt Template

> **Q: "Do I need to learn prompt engineering to make proper requests/instructions/questions to AI?"**

> **A: "You don't study engine structures to drive a car. Just as you learn how to drive well, to give proper instructions to AI, you only need to learn the art of AI conversation rather than prompt engineering."**

With the advancement of generative AI's large language models (LLM-Large Language Model), AI's capabilities have improved dramatically. However, to fully utilize these capabilities, "**clear and specific instructions**" are necessary.

> **The difficulty users face in writing prompts â†’ "How exactly should I phrase it so that you understand my intention correctly?"**

Based on feedback analysis from participants of **"Living with ChatGPT for a Month," "The Art of Prompting," and "Creating My Own AI Employee"** online/offline courses conducted by Everyone's AI over the past year, the following major issues were identified:

1. **Vague Instructions**: Many instances where AI could not provide proper answers due to unclear requests like "Give me a good idea."
2. **Lack of Context**: AI sometimes fails to grasp the user's intent due to insufficient background information or situational explanation.
3. **Excessive Information**: Conversely, providing too much information at once can prevent AI from grasping the core.
4. **Lack of Step-by-Step Instructions**: When requesting complex tasks, the absence of step-by-step instructions can confuse AI.
5. **Absence of Feedback Loop**: Many users are unaware of effective feedback methods to improve AI's responses.

Due to these issues, **users often fail to get the desired results and repeatedly reach the 3-hour 80-prompt limit by adding additional instructions.**

To address these issues, the **SMART+ER Prompt Template** was created. This template is a **structured guideline designed to help even general users easily write effective prompts.** The **SMART+ER template systematizes the core principles of prompt engineering** to enable anyone to communicate more effectively with AI.

- Compared to the third quarter of 2024, the purchase rate of Gen Z customers decreased from 85% to -30% in January 2025, and social media engagement dropped from 60% to -20%.
- The marketing budget for 2025 is 500 million KRW annually, and we lack digital marketing experts.
```

## M: Mission

### Detailed Explanation

The Mission section specifies the specific goal you want to achieve. It is crucial for determining the direction of the solutions AI proposes.

### How to Write

- Present quantifiable goals whenever possible.

# Everyone's AI Meeting Minutes

## Date
Date: April 1, 2025, 12:00~13:30
Location: Everyone's AI Meeting Room

## Meeting Attendees
- Jinwoo Kim (Secretary General)
- Seoyeon Lee (Operations Team Leader)
- Seongho Park (Planning Team Manager)

---

## :speaking_head: Virtual Meeting Conversation (Approx. 12 minutes)

Jinwoo Kim:
Alright, let's start the meeting. Today, we'll discuss the main schedule for the next quarter and improvements to the onboarding process for new member companies. First, could you briefly summarize the next quarter's schedule, Team Leader Seoyeon?

Seoyeon Lee:
Yes. First, the startup policy meeting scheduled for the end of April is the most important, followed by the member company networking day in mid-May, and the semi-annual forum in June. Especially for the policy meeting, we're coordinating the schedule with the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, so finalizing the detailed program is urgent.

Jinwoo Kim:
I also talked to the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, and they said we need to deliver the program proposal by early next week. Manager Seongho, how is the planning team preparing the content?

Seongho Park:
The first draft is ready, and we're organizing the startup positions by policy issue. However, it's taking some time to gather opinions by industry, so I think we can share the entire draft by this Friday.

Seoyeon Lee:
Alright, then our operations team will immediately conduct a survey to gather opinions from member companies and deliver it to the planning team by Friday morning.

Jinwoo Kim:
Sounds good. How about presenting statistics on the startup ecosystem at this meeting? Like growth indicators and investment trends compared to last year.

Seongho Park:
That's a good idea. We'll prepare a simple infographic using existing data and research from KDB and KOSPO. Including it in the presentation will add persuasiveness.

Seoyeon Lee:
Yes, we'll collaborate with the designer from the operations team to assist with the design part. It would be good to schedule a rehearsal before the policy meeting.

Jinwoo Kim:
Let's schedule the rehearsal for two days before the meeting, on April 24th at 3 PM. I'll confirm the attendees and presenters and share it on the calendar.

Seoyeon Lee:
Got it. Let's wrap up the policy meeting and move on to the next agenda item, the onboarding of new member companies. We've received internal feedback that the current response method is insufficient as the number of new sign-ups increases.

Seongho Park:
Yes, especially the initial communication is often slow. There are inquiries about not receiving guidance even after a few days of joining.

Seoyeon Lee:
So, I'd like to propose two main things this time. First, regular online onboarding sessions every other week, and second, composing the welcome kit in digital content form. We're considering moving away from paper-based guides to videos, web guides, and chatbot connections.

Jinwoo Kim:
Sounds good. Especially for the onboarding session, it would be nice to include a Q&A session. Previously, we only responded individually, but summarizing common questions and answering them all at once could be much more efficient.

Seongho Park:
Our planning team will assist with preparing the onboarding session materials. It would be better to create a conversational format rather than a presentation format to keep the representatives from getting bored.

Seoyeon Lee:
Great. For the video content, we'll shoot it in a format where each team leader shares team introductions and tips in under a minute. Short and to the point.

Jinwoo Kim:
Let's create both PDF and web versions of the practical guide, and update the FAQ for frequently asked questions. Also, it seems necessary to revise the welcome email to a more friendly tone than before.

Seongho Park:
Lastly, I'd like to propose one more thing. A method to regularly check the utilization status of new member companies during the initial three months. For example, once a month, the operations team could make a simple contact to check what resources have been used and if there are any needs.

Seoyeon Lee:
That's a really needed part. It's important to have a structure that not only encourages sign-ups but also ensures they are well settled, so continuous participation is possible. The operations team will design that process.

Jinwoo Kim:
Yes, very good. I'll organize the action items based on today's discussion and share them with you by the end of the day. The next meeting will be two weeks from now, on Wednesday at 10 AM, and if there are any special requests, informal meetings are also possible in between.

Seoyeon Lee:
Yes, I'll register the schedule on the calendar. Thank you for your hard work!

Seongho Park:
Thank you all for your hard work. I'll deliver the organized materials by Friday morning!
